Install the PCA and R-Portable program (required for PCA to work).
All necessary libraries are installed.
The program is installed in C: / PCA (highly recommended option!).


To uninstall the program, click on "Uninstall PCA" in the DoE menu or run unis000.exe directly from the C: / PCA folder (manually delete any residual files and the PCA folder)
